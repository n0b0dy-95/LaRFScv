LaRFScv UI v0.1.1 Shiny App

This Shiny app is designed for Lasso Regression with Cross-validation (Lasso-CV). It allows users to perform Lasso regression on a dataset with cross-validation to identify the optimal regularization parameter (lambda) and select significant features. The app provides visualizations and a downloadable CSV file of selected features.

Dependencies:
- shiny: R package for web application development
- glmnet: R package for Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear models
- ggplot2: R package for data visualization

UI Components:
- File Input: Allows users to upload a CSV file containing the dataset.
- Select Input: Enables users to choose the dependent variable from the dataset.
- Numeric Inputs:
  - Number of folds for Cross-validation
  - Coefficient Cut-off
  - Seed value
- Action Buttons:
  - Analyze: Triggers the Lasso regression analysis.
  - Download CSV: Allows users to download a CSV file containing selected features.
- Tabs:
  - MSE vs Log Lambda Plot: Displays the Mean Squared Error (MSE) against Log Lambda values.
  - Selected Features vs Coefficient Plot: Presents the selected features and their coefficients.
  - Selected Features Table: Shows the list of selected features and their corresponding coefficients.
  - Error Message Box: Displays an error message if there is an issue with reading the CSV file.

Server Functions:
- Reading Data: Reads the uploaded CSV file and handles exceptions.
- Updating Input Options: Updates the dependent variable options based on the uploaded dataset.
- Lasso-CV Analysis: Performs Lasso regression with cross-validation and identifies the optimal lambda value.
- Plotting: Renders plots for MSE vs Log Lambda and selected features vs coefficient.
- Feature Selection: Selects significant features based on the provided coefficient cut-off.
- Downloadable CSV: Allows users to download a CSV file containing the selected features.
- Error Handling: Displays an error message if there is an issue with reading the CSV file.

Note: This app is version 0.1 and is subject to further development and enhancements.
